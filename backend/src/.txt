the token(i think) gets expired quiclky-- am just guessing. here is the issue. 
Even after recently logging in, after a certain operation when i chill for like 30 mins and 
come back am asked to login again . 
this might be very annoying for the users. what can we do to solve this






While restricting biometric registration to a single "official" profile section is a standard security practice, it may not address the underlying technical issue if your playground and production systems share the same database.
Why the Overwrite is Happening
The core problem is likely shared data storage. If your "playground" (testing environment) and your "biometric/login system" (production environment) both write to the same user record or facial template database, adding a face in one will naturally overwrite the other. 
Is Limiting Registration to "Profile" the Best Solution?
Restricting the registration point is a good security measure, but it is only a partial solution for your technical conflict.
Pros: It ensures that only "vetted" images are used for actual authentication, preventing low-quality "playground" tests from ruining login reliability.
Cons: If the underlying code still points to the same database field, you may still accidentally overwrite data if you ever need to test registration features in the playground. 
Recommended Best Practices (2025)
To permanently solve this without losing your "playground" functionality, implement the following:
Separate Databases (Environment Isolation): Use a separate database or collection for your playground. Testing data should never touch production login credentials.
Versioned Biometric Templates: Instead of having one face_template field per user, use an array or a related table that stores multiple templates. You can then tag them (e.g., type: "login" or type: "playground_test").
Profile-Only Registration: As you suggested, limit the "Official Biometric" registration to a secure, authenticated profile page. This follows the Principle of Least Privilege, ensuring that experimental areas (the playground) cannot modify sensitive authentication data.
Use Hashed Templates: Ensure you are storing mathematical representations (hashes/templates) rather than raw images to comply with modern data privacy standards like GDPR or CCPA. 
Summary of Action Steps
Restrict: Move all "Login Face" registration to the secure user profile section only.
Isolate: Ensure your playground writes to a different database or uses a specific "test" flag in your user records so it does not interfere with the active_login_face.
Validate: Only allow the active_login_face to be updated after a successful secondary authentication (e.g., password or OTP).
